# CS162 - Software Development
This is a repository of my assignment submissions for the CS162 course.

1. [Kanban Board](./kanban-board/)
    
    A CRUD application that uses the Flask micro web framework to implement a simple kanban board for task organization. The kanban board has draggable task items that can be added via an input form and deleted using a button at the side of each task.

2. [Real Ventures DB](./database_application/)

    A database application that uses SQLAlchemy to insert and query data e.g. Top agents and offices, average sale price etc. from the local database. The relationships between the objects are laid out in the Entity relationship diagram and the instructions to run the program is outlined in the `README.md`.
